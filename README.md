# Configrity README file #

Configrity is a configuration library for Scala 2.9 or
+. Configuration instances are immutable, thread-safe and allow
functional design patterns, such as:

  - Getting options to values
  - Converting implicitly values via type-classes
  - Reader monad

The API is now stable and covered by tests. However, as it is very young,
it may contain some bugs.

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/paradigmatic/Configrity.png)](http://travis-ci.org/paradigmatic/Configrity)

## Example ##

    import org.streum.configrity._
    
    val config = Configuration.load( "server.conf" )

    val hostname = config[String]("host")
    val port = config[Int]("port")

    val updatedConfig = config.set ("port",8080 )
    upddatedConfig.save( "local.conf" )	

## Features ##

### Implemented ###

  - Automatic values conversions via type classes.
  - Loading configurations from any source (File, InputStream, URL, etc.)
  - Loading configurations from system properties and environment variables.
  - Saving configurations to files.
  - Interoperability with java properties.
  - Hierarchical configuration blocks.
  - Configuration chaining (such as to provide default values).
  - Single import: `import org.streum.configrity._` imports all you need.
  - Access through reader monads
  - Values can be lists (v0.7.0)
  - Extra value converters: File, Color, URL, URI (v0.7.0)
  - `include` directive is supported, adding compatibility with Akka and
     Configgy configurations files.
  - Loading configurations from classpath/resources (v0.9.0)
  - YAML format support (v0.10.0)

### Planned ###
  
  - More export/Import formats: INI, JSON, XML, apache, etc.
  - Build configurations from command line arguments

## Requirements ##

Configrity depends on Scala 2.8.1 or newer.

While core features do not depend on external libraries, some modules
may. In that case, the approriate dependencies will be automatically
installed by sbt/maven.

## Installation ##

### From SBT ###

The dependency line is:

    "org.streum" %% "configrity-core" % "0.10.2"

Additional modules require addition dependency lines. Check the wiki
for more information:
<https://github.com/paradigmatic/Configrity/wiki/Modules>

### From Maven, Buildr, Ivy, Grape and Grails ###

Follow the [repository instructions](http://search.maven.org/#artifactdetails|org.streum|configrity-core_2.9.2|0.10.2|jar).
    

### From source (master branch) ###

To install Configrity you just need a working java installation (tested with
JDK 1.6, but may work with 1.5) and SBT **0.11+**:

    $ git clone git://github.com/paradigmatic/Configrity.git
    $ cd Configrity
    $ sbt
    > test
    > doc
    > package

If you want to cross-build, you will need to generate adapters for Scala 2.8.x
via [sbt-scalashim](https://github.com/sbt/sbt-scalashim):

    $ sbt
    > project configrity-core
    > scalashim
    > project configrity
    > +test
    > +package
